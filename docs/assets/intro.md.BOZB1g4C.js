It provides:</p><ul><li><strong>App layer</strong> — You define an app by its id, name, version, and the set of extensions it uses. The framework handles registration, lifecycle, and rendering.</li><li><strong>Extension system</strong> — Features (editor, terminal, AI, settings, etc.) are packaged as extensions. Each extension registers with the core and can contribute UI and commands.</li><li><strong>Contributions</strong> — Declarative UI: tabs in sidebars, buttons on toolbars, HTML blocks. Contributions are bound to targets (e.g. main sidebar, bottom panel).</li><li><strong>Commands</strong> — Named actions with handlers. Toolbars and menus reference commands; the command palette and AI can execute them.</li><li><strong>Core services</strong> — Workspace, settings, dialogs, tasks, events, and dependency injection.</li></ul><p>You can build a <strong>downstream app</strong> by defining an <code>AppDefinition</code> and choosing which extensions to enable, or author <strong>new extensions</strong> that register with <code>extensionRegistry</code>, <code>contributionRegistry</code>, and <code>commandRegistry</code>.</p><p>See <a href="/docs/concepts/architecture.html">Architecture</a> and the <a href="/docs/guide/getting-started.html">Guide</a> for details.</p>',5)])])}const m=t(o,[["render",i]]);export{h as __pageData,m as default};
