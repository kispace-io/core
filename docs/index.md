# Introduction

**Appspace** is a modular web framework for building IDE-like applications with a plugin architecture, AI integration, and workspace management.

This documentation is for **developers** who want to:

- **Build applications** on top of Appspace — define your app, pick extensions, and ship.
- **Create extensions** — add commands, sidebar tabs, toolbars, and custom UI that plug into the framework.

## Live example

A full app built on Appspace: [https://app.kispace.de](https://app.kispace.de).

## Repository

Source and issue tracker: [github.com/kispace-io/appspace](https://github.com/kispace-io/appspace).

## Next steps

- [Getting started](/guide/getting-started) — run the default app and build for production.
- [Concepts](/concepts/architecture) — apps, extensions, contributions, and commands.
- [Build your own app](/guide/build-your-own-app) — use the default app as a template.
